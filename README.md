This is the first mobile app that I'm attempting. 

It was a small Uni project intended to teach us the absolute basics of Android Studio(I personally used IntelliJ). It utilizes Plain Old Java and nothing more

I plan on revisiting this project in the future to polish and maybe create a computer opponent that the player plays against and maybe try out a framework or two.
